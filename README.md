# slickness-saver

Slickness Saver was built to assist users in analyzing the slickness of roads and weather conditions along a given route. Applications range from helping roadside assistance personnel better respond in harsh weather conditions, to designing a safer passage for common drivers.

Everything in the ESRI folder was not created by me, but I included the files in here because I am using a non-current version of it (release candidate 5). The current version can be found <a href="https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/">here</a>.
